# Logging Strategy

Effective logging is crucial for debugging, monitoring, and understanding the behavior of applications, especially in a multi-language and multi-platform environment.

## General Principles:

1.  **Structured Logging**:
    *   Whenever possible, use structured logging (e.g., JSON format). This makes logs easier to parse, search, and analyze by machines.
    *   Include common fields like `timestamp`, `level` (e.g., DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL), `module` (or component name), and a descriptive `message`.
    *   Platform-specific or application-specific context should also be included (e.g., `platform_id`, `thread_id`, `request_id`).

2.  **Configurable Log Levels**:
    *   Applications should allow runtime configuration of log verbosity, ideally per module. This can be controlled via environment variables, configuration files, or command-line arguments.

3.  **Timestamp Consistency**:
    *   Use UTC for timestamps in logs to avoid ambiguity across time zones. ISO 8601 format is recommended (e.g., `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS.sssZ`).

4.  **Additive Logging**:
    *   Logs should be appended to existing log files or streams rather than overwriting them, to preserve history.
    *   Implement log rotation for long-running applications to manage disk space (e.g., size-based or time-based rotation).

5.  **Contextual Information**:
    *   Logs should provide enough context to understand the state of the application when the log message was generated.

### Language-Specific Recommendations:

*   **Python**:
    *   Use the built-in `logging` module.
    *   Configure it for structured logging (e.g., using `python-json-logger`).
    *   Example basic configuration:
        ```python
        import logging
        logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO,
                            format='%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(name)s - %(message)s',
                            datefmt='%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S')
        logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
        logger.info("This is an info message.")
        ```

*   **Rust**:
    *   Use crates like `log` (facade) along with an implementer like `env_logger`, `slog`, or `tracing`.
    *   `tracing` is powerful for structured and asynchronous logging.
    *   Example with `env_logger` and `log`:
        ```rust
        // In main.rs or lib.rs
        // extern crate log; // Pre-2018 edition
        // extern crate env_logger; // Pre-2018 edition

        fn main() {
            std::env::set_var("RUST_LOG", "info"); // Set default log level
            env_logger::init();
            log::info!("This is an info message from Rust.");
            log::warn!("This is a warning!");
        }
        ```

*   **C**:
    *   Use a library like `spdlog` (if C++ interop is acceptable for the logging part), `zlog`, or a custom logging solution.
    *   For simple cases, `fprintf` to `stderr` or a log file, prefixed with timestamps and levels, can suffice for initial prototyping.
    *   Example (very basic):
        ```c
        #include <stdio.h>
        #include <time.h>
        // Define log levels
        #define LOG_LEVEL_INFO 0
        #define LOG_LEVEL_ERROR 1
        void app_log(int level, const char *module, const char *message) {
            time_t now = time(NULL);
            char buf[sizeof("YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ")];
            strftime(buf, sizeof(buf), "%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ", gmtime(&now));
            fprintf(stderr, "[%s] [%s] [%s] %s\n", buf,
                    (level == LOG_LEVEL_INFO ? "INFO" : "ERROR"),
                    module, message);
        }
        // app_log(LOG_LEVEL_INFO, "MAIN_C", "Application started.");
        ```

*   **C++**:
    *   Use libraries like `spdlog`, `glog`, or `Boost.Log`. `spdlog` is often recommended for its performance and ease of use.
    *   Example with `spdlog` (conceptual, requires library setup):
        ```cpp
        // #include "spdlog/spdlog.h"
        // #include "spdlog/sinks/basic_file_sink.h"
        // try {
        //     auto logger = spdlog::basic_logger_mt("basic_logger", "logs/basic-log.txt");
        //     spdlog::set_default_logger(logger);
        //     spdlog::info("Welcome to spdlog!");
        // } catch (const spdlog::spdlog_ex &ex) {
        //     std::cout << "Log init failed: " << ex.what() << std::endl;
        // }
        ```

### Log Aggregation (Future Consideration):

For distributed systems or multiple components running simultaneously (common in multi-platform scenarios), consider a centralized logging solution:
*   Tools like Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana (ELK stack), Fluentd, Grafana Loki, or cloud-based logging services.
*   Applications would send logs to a central aggregator for easier analysis and monitoring.

This logging strategy will be refined as specific project needs and platforms are developed.
