# Cargo.lock is usually committed for binary projects for reproducible builds.
# For libraries, it's often gitignored. Given this is a prototyping repo
# that might spawn various things, let's keep Cargo.lock versioned for now
# within the src/rust directory if cargo init created it there.
# If Cargo.lock is in src/rust, this .gitignore at root won't affect it unless specified as /src/rust/Cargo.lock
